Every single person who worked on Java would have created an Object at some point of time. Well, what is actually an Object actually? 

Its nothing but a real-life entity expressed programatically. So, while creating an object, you might have created the getters and setters for each and every single variable in your class object.

```java
class Car {
    private String carName;
    private int carPrice;
    private String colour;
}

```
